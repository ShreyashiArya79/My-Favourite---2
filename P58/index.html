        <p>Painting has been a hobby I have embraced for quite some time. Ever since I took the paintbrush and just crafted something on paper, I have never looked back on it. Painting has been a hobby that gives me joy because I can draw my imaginations into an art piece and make the best out of it.In my own free time, I find peace in painting and looking back to how I spend my leisure, and it has undoubtedly been worth it. My paintings have been quite inspiring to my friends and me as they are mostly of issues in life. Once I sat down and set my mind on a painting, I tend to get into the brush itself and paint just as how I view the inspiration.As people look for hobbies to engage in, there are certain benefits they look forward to reaping in it. Painting as a hobby has been a great way to relax. In life, I encounter challenges and various stumbling blocks.I look for my escape in painting so that I can breathe and think about my issues in my own space. When I get challenges instead of overthinking, I tend to draw my energy into painting because the brush has a vibe with me.I can breathe and paint, and after crafting my art, I feel at peace and relax because I put my focus and think peacefully about the matter. My friends have seen me paint when I am having issues, and they tend to note the tone of my painting reflects my mood because I paint based on issues of life.</p>
